Since certain conferences and training vendors (we won't name names)
suggest only the most meager of food options, here is a list of
alternatives.

## pizza

### joe squared

http://joesquared.com

Joe Squared has two locations: the original in the Station North
neighborhood, and an expansion in the Inner Harbor. Their coal-fired,
square pizzas have more options than you likely can
imagine. Additionally, apparently their risotto is to die for.

A decent carft beer list can be found here as well.

#### station north

At night, live music is a hit here. Except Wednesday nights, where,
yes, you will find a Mario Kart tournament.

## beer

### Brewer's Art

In addition to awesome Belgian-style brewing, their dinner menu is
superb. The portions are relatively small, but the food is exceedingly
high quality and not as expensive as other restaurants of interest to
the "I must Instagram all of my meals" crowd.

**From the Inner Harbor:** MTA Light Rail Northbound to Penn Station;
  walk 3.5 blocks South on Charles Street

### Pratt Street Ale House

http://www.prattstreetalehouse.com

201 W Pratt St

Sports pub with its own brews, and a prime location across the street
from the convention center. Great for a quick lunch of one or more
pints.

**From the Inner Harbor:** Uh, it's on Pratt Street, just east of, and
  across the street from, the Light Rail.

## foodie worthy

### Woodberry Kitchen

Possibly the pinnacle of farm-to-table New American cuisine, Woodberry
Kitchen combines a farmhouse ambiance with mind-altering food, a
curated wine list and cocktails made from local and organic spirits.

**From the Inner Harbor:** MTA Light Rail Northbound (towards Hunt
  Valley) to Woodberry; exit station to the north at Union; make a
  left and continue up Clipper 1 block; make a left on Clipper Park;
