Since certain conferences and training vendors (we won't name names)
suggest only the most meager of food options, here is a list of
alternatives.

## pizza

### joe squared

Joe Squared has two locations: the original in the Station North
neighborhood, and an expansion in the Inner Harbor. Their coal-fired,
square pizzas have more options than you likely can
imagine. Additionally, apparently their risotto is to die for.

A decent carft beer list can be found here as well.

#### station north

At night, live music is a hit here. Except Wednesday nights, where,
yes, you will find a Mario Kart tournament.
