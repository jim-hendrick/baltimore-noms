Since certain conferences and training vendors (we won't name names)
suggest only the most meager of food options, here is a list of
alternatives.

## seafood

### nick's oyster bar

http://www.nicksoysterbar.com

Known for its happy hours full of delicious oysters.

## pizza

### joe squared

http://joesquared.com

Joe Squared has two locations: the original in the Station North
neighborhood, and an expansion in the Inner Harbor. Their coal-fired,
square pizzas have more options than you likely can
imagine. Additionally, apparently their risotto is to die for.

A decent craft beer list can be found here as well.

#### station north

At night, live music is a hit here. Except Wednesday nights, where,
yes, you will find a Mario Kart tournament.

## beer/pub

### Brewer's Art

http://www.thebrewersart.com/

In addition to awesome Belgian-style brewing, their dinner menu is
superb. The portions are relatively small, but the food is exceedingly
high quality and not as expensive as other restaurants of interest to
the "I must Instagram all of my meals" crowd.

 - 1106 North Charles Street
 - +1 410 547-6925
 - info@thebrewersart.com

**From the Inner Harbor:** MTA Light Rail Northbound to Penn Station;
  walk 3.5 blocks South on Charles Street

### Pratt Street Ale House

http://www.prattstreetalehouse.com

 - 206 W. Pratt St
 - +1 410 244-8900
 
Sports pub with its own brews, and a prime location across the street
from the convention center. Great for a quick lunch of one or more
pints.

**From the Inner Harbor:** Uh, it's on Pratt Street, just east of, and
  across the street from, the Light Rail.

### Sláinte

http://www.slaintepub.com/

 - 1700 Thames Street
 - +1 410 563-6600

Pub that serves a pretty convincing Irish breakfast, and has soccer on
the TVs as much as humanly possible.

   + Saturday-Sunday 0700-1300

  (http://www.baltimorewatertaxi.com/) Red Route from Harborplace
  (near Pratt & Light) to Fells Point. The pub is right across the
  street from the ferry landing.
